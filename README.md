Puzzpak Senior project, imcorporates Memorygame, TikTak, Hangman, and a Local Leaderboard Database.

A user can pick from 4 games:
  * Hangman
  * Tik-Tak
  * Memorytiles 4x4
  * Memorytiles 6x6
  
which they get a score from after playing, and the score goes up to a leaderboard on a local database (for now).  This is meant to give the application an arcade-like feel, where the highscores for each game are shown for all-time, and top-10.  they're displayed in a jtable from a resultset that come from  a SQL query.
